# Data Prepup

I just have to do it differently this time around if i don't want to get same result.

To begin with, I joined 66DaysOfData discord server as I needed a community of like minds tracking their daily progress. I felt I could get some motivation and also have those to whom I hold my accountability.

Immediately I joined 66DaysOfData discord server, I broke my shell by informing the community about my habit of not holding on to my journey into data each time I start. I conciously took that route so as to have something taking me back to record my progress with the community.

Next up, I needed a place to also track what I've learned and references to used resources, which is the purpose of this [Github repository](https://github.com/spaceofmiah/66DaysOfData.git).
