# Day Seven

Got an introductory background to reinforcement learning, where an agent is rewarded based on action perform in achieving an end goal. This kind of learning doesn't require labelled input as the agent gets to learn from past experiences and improve it's chances of getting a higher reward. 

Reward function accredits rewards to an agent based on the action taken.

Much of the study on this topic is gotten from AWS M.L Engineering course on Udemy. In this course reinforcement learning is made simple with SageMaker and [DeepRacer](https://console.aws.amazon.com/deepracer/home?region=us-east-1#welcome) allowing engineers an environment to learn while building an autonomous vehicle that learns overtime from it's environment, how to navigate a track, factoring driving accuracy and speed.
