# Day Six

_2 days work out_

Revisit the basics of vectorization with focus based on how `np.dot` operator works. I had to learn about matrix multiplication. During this also brush through `matmul (@)`. 

Two point worthy of note is that

- matrix multiplication demands the col of the first array to be same as the row of the second array

- the result of matrix multiplication would have the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of col of the second matrix.
